### 8. Data Access Flow
```
Request → Controller → Transaction Wrapper → Service → Validation → Repository → DB
```

**Layers:**
1. **Controller**: HTTP handling, transaction initiation
2. **BaseController**: Transaction management, error handling
3. **Service**: Business logic, validation orchestration
4. **Validation Service**: Data validation rules
5. **Repository**: Data access, database operations

## Architecture Highlights

### Transaction Flow Example
```csharp
// User calls: POST /api/appointments/schedule-with-invoice
{
  "patientId": 1,
  "doctorId": 1,
  "appointmentDate": "2025-01-28",
  "appointmentTime": "10:00",
  "reason": "Annual checkup",
  "visitFee": 150.00
}

// Controller (AppointmentsController)
BaseController.ExecuteWithTransactionAsync(async () => {
    // Service (AppointmentBookingService)
    - Validates appointment
    - Creates appointment entity
    - Creates invoice entity (with tax calculation)
    - Both added to DbContext
})

// On success:
// - Both appointment and invoice saved to database
// - Transaction committed
// - Returns 201 Created with both entities

// On failure:
// - Transaction rolled back
// - No partial data saved
// - Returns appropriate error (400/500)
```

### Validation Flow Example
```csharp
// Patient Creation
1. Controller receives Patient object
2. Calls PatientService.CreatePatientAsync()
3. Service calls PatientValidationService
4. Validation checks:
   - Required fields present
   - Email format valid
   - Email unique
   - Phone format valid
   - Date of birth not in future
5. Service applies business logic (IsActive = true, CreatedDate)
6. Service calls PatientRepository.AddAsync()
7. Controller commits transaction
```

### Business Rules Implemented

#### Patients
- Cannot delete patient with existing appointments
- Email must be unique across all patients
- Date of birth cannot be in the future

#### Doctors
- Cannot delete doctor with existing appointments
- License number must be unique
- Email must be unique

#### Appointments
- Patient must exist
- Doctor must exist
- Date/time cannot be in the past
- Status must be valid (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled)

#### Invoices
- One invoice per appointment
- Subtotal cannot be negative
- Total calculated: SubTotal + (SubTotal × TaxRate)
- Invoice number auto-generated
